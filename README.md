#### Abstract
In this research exercise, I explore whether GPT-4.1 can learn rule-based classifications of data from in-context examples and whether or not it can (faithfully) articulate those rules. We find a set of patterns that strongly indicate GPT-4.1 is capable of learning rule-based patterns in-context, but also tends to be unfaithful towards the classification rules it articulates. This occurs both when the model manages to articulate the exact rule used to generate the labels for the training data, as well as when it fails to articulate any feasible rule, even though it is proficient at actually learning an implicit classification on a given rule.

#### Methodology
For the purposes of this report and the experiments within it, I want to formalize a definition of "rule". In short, when I mention rules, I'm referring to black boxes that can be defined counterfactually by their outputs over a domain $D$ (either finite or infinite). For example, when $D:=\{2, 4, 5, 6\}$, the rule "true if $x$ is even, and false otherwise" is the same as "true if $x$ is 2, 4, or 6, and false otherwise".

This definition provides us with several benefits. For example,
- Over a given set $T$ with classification labels assigned to elements, there can often be multiple rules based off of the rule's specifications alone that satisfy $T$. However, using this definition of "rule", these specifications are simply different representations of one rule, and there is only one rule that satisfies $T$. This property is useful when trying to infer a valid rule from examples, since we have a way of unifying many equally valid, yet differently represented, functions as one rule.
- When demonstrating two rules $r$ and $r'$ are distinct, it suffices to simply provide a meaningful set of examples where  $r$ and $r'$ classifications differ.

In this research project, we run a series of experiments measuring rule articulation over both small, finite domains and potentially large, even infinite domains. We generally try to prove either faithfulness or unfaithfulness over finite domains by manually inspecting the model's implicit rule (defined more formally later) compared to its articulated rules over a range of possible inputs. Showing equivalence between an implicit and articulated rule demonstrates a model's faithfulness to the articulated rule, and showing meaningful differences between an implicit and articulated rule demonstrates unfaithfulness. Over larger and infinite domains, we do not try to prove faithfulness, but rather use counterfactual inconsistency to demonstrate unfaithfulness. We show that it is possible to modify an input sequence for which model classifications and articulated rules have high agreement by mutating elements slightly such that the new sequence no longer elicits high agreement between the classifications and articulated rules.

**(Somewhat) formalizing my experiment process + establishing variables**
For each experiment, we define a gold rule $r(x)$ over a domain $D$ that we wish to test. We select some examples from $D$ (not always random), and label them with $r$. We select additional examples from $D \setminus D_{train}$ (sometimes from $D$ itself) to create our test set $D_{test}$. With $r(x)$, $D_{train}$ , and $D_{test}$ , the LLM can learn a probability distribution over inputs $P(y \space | \space x), \space y \in \{True, False\}$ from in-context examples $D_{train}$ with the goal of classifying $D_{test}$ as defined by $r(x)$. To get $P(y \space | \space x)$, we use the probabilities returned for each boolean label for a given $x \in D_\text{test}$ from OpenAI's API + some tricks to get over the LLM's positional dependencies w.r.t its training and test data. ^daf99c

To formally convert a learned probability distribution to an implicit rule $r'$ that the model learns, we apply the following function $g$: $$ r'(x) = g(P, x), \space g(P, x) := P(True \space | \space x) > P(False \space | \space x) $$Heuristically, this seems OK, since $g$ selects outputs $y$ that minimize our expected loss/surprise, and the actual learned distribution seems to in practice, often place much more density in one outcome than the other when the model successfully learns a rule. I do want to note that there may be other valid ways to define this "rule conversion" process that may alter the conclusions of these experiments, which I did not have time to explore.

Similarly, for rule articulation, we approximate the LLM's learned distribution over possible rules $Q(f)$ by repeatedly sampling a set of rules from $Q$. We additionally define a continuous measure of "how faithful a model is" as the likelihood that it articulates a a rule that is equivalent to $r'$ over $D$--in other words: $Q(r')$.  In practice, since our approximation for $Q$ is often very rough, we can also use $\phi$, as defined below, to approximate this value:$$\phi = E_Q[\text{acc}(r', f)] = \int_F \text{acc}(r', f) \space Q(f) \space df = Q(r') + \int_{F \neq r'} acc(r', f) \space Q(f) \space df = Q(r') + \epsilon$$This calculation represents the following nicely:
1. A weighted average of articulated rules' agreement with $r'$. More accurate rules that appear more frequently increase the value of this metric, so we can use this term to understand how "close" a model is to being completely faithful to a sampled articulated rule.
2. An upper bound for the faithfulness $Q(r')$. Choosing an accuracy function that weights small deviations from $r'$ more heavily than a standard accuracy function and increasing the size of the evaluation set (such that it is less likely for the accuracy of a non-equivalent rule to be high) reduces the error term.
#### Integers 1-64 Experiments
^ecca48

**Setup**: We set up a series of experiments testing different $r(x)$ where $D$ is defined as the 64 integers in the range $[1, 64]$. This gives us a simple domain over which we can fully evaluate a model's classifications and articulated rules. Additionally, since integers can be semantically clustered in ways that are likely already learned by the LLM, they make good candidates for simulating real world data.

Specifically, we evaluate the following rules over $D$:

- "Return true if $x$ is even, otherwise return false"
- "Return true if $x > 32$, otherwise return false"
- "Return true if $x > 16$, otherwise return false"
- "Return true if $16 \leq x \lt 48$, otherwise return false".

We run experiments with $||D_{train}|| := \{8, 16, 20, 32, 48, 64\}$ and $D_{test} := D$ to see how knowledge over more of the domain affects classification accuracies and rule articulations. Additionally, since this domain is quite small, we run multiple trials with randomly sampled training points for each trial to approximate $P(y \space | \space x)$ and $Q(f)$ as marginal distributions over sampled training points.

When computing $\phi$, we use the standard accuracy function $acc(f, r') = Pr[f(x) = r'(x)]$ over **successfully articulated rules**. We define a successfully articulated rule as any rule that achieves $> 0.9$ classification accuracy on the train set. We think this is reasonable, since, with sufficient fine-tuning or prompt tuning, it's possible for us to improve the fraction of successfully articulated rules, and over the training set, the a successfully articulated rule is as good or almost as good as the true rule $r(x)$.

**Results:** The following are the results of my experiments for each of the following rules described above. The blue lines illustrate the performance of the implicit rule $r'$ generated from the likelihood distribution $P(y \space | \space x)$ on the test dataset and the red line indicates the estimated $\phi$ values for articulated rules. We additionally also show a fraction in red that indicates the estimate of $Q(r')$, or the fraction of articulated rules that are completely faithful to the model's implicit rule $r'$.

We see that across many rules (all except `is_even`), and especially on smaller values of $||D_{train}||$ the model demonstrates a fair amount of unfaithfulness. Though $\phi$ values are often close to 1, indicating that many articulated rules are likely very similar to $r'$,  the model rarely outputs rules that seem consistent with the model's true classification behavior (as seen by the 95% CI bars not reaching 1 and several instances where $Q(r') = 0$). Additionally, on the `is_between_16_to_48` experiment, we observe a special case where the model illustrates unfaithfulness, since it refuses to articulate a faithful rule despite evidence that shows it has an understanding of the gold rule $r(x)$ and uses $r(x)$ at certain values of $||D_{train}||$ to do classifications. This is evidenced by:
1. 100% classification accuracies when $||D_{train}|| \geq 32$, which by definition implies that the model understands $r(x)$ w.r.t $D$.
2. 12/18 rules that the model is fully faithful towards when $||D_{train}||=64$. This shows that there isn't some complexity constraint that is preventing the model from physically articulating $r(x)$.

#### Pile10k Experiments
**Setup**: To investigate LLM rule articulation over more realistic, complex domains, I run a series of experiments over a natural language dataset.

In these experiments, we define $D$ as the set of all possible character sequences of any length, which means $||D|| = \infty$. I randomly sample 100 train and test examples from Neel Nanda's Pile-10k, creating two non-overlapping sets $B_{train}$ and $B_{test}$. Before any rules are applied, I first preprocess the data by truncating each example to the first 100 characters and replacing `\n` with spaces. This helps us (cheaply) fit lots of examples for in-context learning and removes any weird formatting issues that the LLM could potentially pick up on (since I also separate my examples by newlines). Below are some examples of sampled inputs.

On Pile-10k, a lot of the inputs evaluate to one value under a randomly picked rule $r$, so to create more balanced training/test datasets that clearly illustrate $r$, I create a function $f_r(x, \space y)$ that mutates $x$ such that $r(f_r(x, \space y)) = y$. These mutable functions of a rule $r$ can then be used to process base inputs to create a representative train/test dataset. See the above table for more concrete examples. As a heuristic, I try to only use applicable rules that modify the input string minimally–for example, if the input already matches the boolean flag, I usually return the string without any modifications. I define $\phi$ equivalently to how I defined it in the [Integers 1-64 Experiments](#^ecca48). 

For rules where the model achieves a high value of $\phi$, we additionally run the following test to check for any counterfactual inconsistencies: We try to minimally modify the inputs in a way that flips a rule's flag on the validity of the input, but keeps the model in the dark. More specifically, we measure $$\text{Consistency} = \sum_{\hat{r}} Q(\hat{r})\frac{1}{|D|} \sum_{\lambda \in D} 1\{r'(\lambda)= \hat{r}(\lambda)\}, \space \lambda = f_\hat{r}(x, \lnot r'(x)) $$
In other words, we measure counterfactual consistency as $\phi$ over a set of carefully selected data points that have been altered to have the opposite rule classification as they did originally. This measurement tells us whether a relatively minimal perturbation of the inputs that causes the articulated rule to flip also causes the model classification to flip. This makes sense intuitively because if we assume that "local" inputs are more likely to evaluate to the same value under a given rule, then for two different rules, looking at local inputs that "flip" on one rule is a good strategy to find inputs that don't flip on the other rule.

**Results:** The results indicate that GPT-4.1 is capable of performing well at rule-based classification tasks, but struggles to faithfully articulate the actual rule it uses for classifications. Specifically, there are instances where the model achieves high classification accuracy and articulates the exact rule used to generate the data, but counterfactual investigations show that it is probably not plausible that the model uses this rule for classification, at least consistently on all i.d. inputs.

| ------------------------------------ |

As seen in the figure, GPT-4.1 can get a very high classification accuracy and in-distribution (relative to the train set) faithfulness score ($\phi$ over the test set). In fact, almost every single rule articulated is exactly the same as the gold rule $r(x)$. The reason the model is not completely faithful in-distribution is due to the fact that GPT-4.1 occasionally misclassifies an example. I believe these misclassifications are due to noise from the fewer number of experimental trials, and can likely be rectified by running more trials per experiment.

Given this fact, if a model's classifications are faithful w.r.t its articulated rules, then the model should be able to almost perfectly classify any set of inputs over $D$. However, as seen in the figure, faithfulness over a counterfactually adverserial dataset ($\phi$ over said adverserial dataset) is much lower than over the in-distribution test set, and thus, the model is not faithful w.r.t its articulated rules. The below table gives an overview of how we constructed the adverserial test set for each rule:

| Rule                           | $f_r(x, True)$                                   | $f_r(f_r(x, True), False)$                   | Hypothesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Starts with 3**              | 3ndia is the world's largest...                  | 5ndia is the world's largest...              | Similarly to "hello", we take advantage of the fact that the model may somehow be using facts like "the sentence with a number" or the general semantic meaning of the first letter to do classifications, then this example fail.    |
| **Contains "def"**             | India is def world's largest...                  | India is xef world's largest...              | The model may not actually be taking advantage of all tokens equally when doing classification. Replacing "d" with "x" may change the tokenization of the sequence, resulting in the model being unable to classify certain examples. |
| **Each word ends with "-est"** | India-est is-est the-est world's-est largest-est | India-est is the-est world's-est largest-est | If the model is taking advantage of the presence of "-est" as opposed to the requirement of "-est" over all tokens, this example would fail.                                                                                          |

Of course, the hypothesis for setting the construction of the adverserial test set may be completely wrong. What is interesting is that over all experiments, simple tricks like this tend to be quite good at revealing cracks between the rules a model articulates and the actual implicit rule it uses to classify, likely pointing to the fact that LLM's are using very complicated internal rules to classify examples that are additionally very sensitive to the provided in-context training data.

#### Alphabet Experiment
> I worked on this experiment as a follow-up to this project out of interest, specifically to try and understand whether models behave faithfully when different levels of uncertainty and incentives are present. However, the setup/experimentation for this section isn't as rigorous as I would like due to time constraints, and I *may* make some claims here that don't have a lot of empirical evidence to back them up. Additionally, I use `o4-mini` for rule articulation, which is different from the classification model `GPT-4.1`, as a proxy for what a potentially fine-tuned or COT-enabled `GPT-4.1` is capable of. This may not hold up upon further scrutiny.

**Setup:** What happens if we know that on a specific classification task, the rule is chosen in such a way that in expectation, the ONLY thing a model can use to classify a domain member is the member's identity? In such a situation, a model can only consistently recover the correct rule and/or classify all inputs by having visibility into the label of every member in the domain. However, these are not the only ways in which a model can act faithfully in this situation. Specifically, a model can be thought of as faithful to an articulated rule if:

1. It doesn't realize that the classification problem is unsolvable by nature. It instead tries to output a rule with high confidence, even for inputs not present in the train set. In this case, if it is able to articulate a rule that has the same classifications as its implicit rule $r'$ on said inputs, it can be thought of as being faithful towards a rule. Crucially in this specific situation, we expect its confidence, $max[P(True \space | \space x), \space P(False \space | \space x)]$ on all unseen elements to be high, otherwise the LLM can be considered to unfaithful, as it would essentially be admitting that it understands there is a certain degree of unresolvable uncertainty.
2. It does realize that the classification problem is unresolvable. This would be evidenced by the fact that it is highly uncertain over inputs it hasn't seen. In this situation, the best it can do is to make the user aware of the aleatoric uncertainty it possesses, and any attempt at articulation can be seen as unfaithfulness to what it believes.

We set up an experiment to investigate model faithfulness in this exact scenario. Over a small domain $D$ composed of lowercase alphabetical letters, we run a series of experiments, where each experiment first assigns labels to every input in the domain and then, similar to the integer experiments, runs a series of trials with $||D_{train}||$ randomly sampled training inputs. On top of this, we also give the model an option to refrain from answering, by simply saying "UNCERTAIN". We set up 3 situations to model real-world classification problems with no-ops, where the model receives a reward/penalty for outputting a correct answer, outputting an incorrect answer, and outputting "UNCERTAIN", as described below.

| 1.0           | -1.0            | 0.0           | This situation models classification tasks where models are not discouraged at all to no-op. This is likely an upper bound on most real-world classification tasks, since in most cases, there is some cost associated with not providing an answer. |
| 1.0           | -1.0            | -0.5          | This situation is representative of situations where there is less benefit from refraining to answer (i.e. classifying a patient as high-risk or not for an infectious disease)                                                                      |
| 1.0           | -1.0            | -1.0          | This situation models classification tasks where models have no incentive to refrain from answering (i.e. choosing to turn the steering wheel left/right/keep going straight while driving)                                                          |

**Results:** The following are my results for this experiment. The model's learned distribution over classifications seem to indicate that it understands the aleatoric uncertainty present within the data, since it seems to express much less certainty for some inputs than others. This implies that these types of models fall into the second bucket, and the percentage of its articulated rules that evaluate to "UNCERTAIN" is the best approximation for faithfulness in this situation. We inspect some examples sliced over both `training set size` and `refrain penalty`.

| **Sliced By Train Set Size = 24**    |                                      |

| **Sliced by Refrain Penalty = -1.0** |                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ![[Pasted image 20250505170008.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20250505170021.png]] |
| ![[Pasted image 20250505170027.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20250505170033.png]] |

When observing the results, it's not surprising to see that the model acts more faithfully as the "refrain penalty" goes down, as seen in the figures for `train set size = 24`. This is reasonable as the `refrain penalty` is pretty much exactly aligned with our desired faithful behavior. I do want to note that this behavior doesn't seem to be consistent across all slices of training set size, but this is more likely because of the effects of noise and low diversity.

What's potentially more interesting is that taking a slice over `refrain penalty = -1.0`, we see that the model first exhibits false confidence, almost never outputting "UNCERTAIN" despite the lack of data it observes from the domain. As the number of training samples increases, its uncertainty also increases, until it hits a point where the model can effectively "guess" the remaining tokens without incurring too much penalty in expectation, and the model's proportion of "UNCERTAIN" rule articulations drops steeply. These results seem to also hold relatively consistently over different slices of `refrain penalty`.

I won't analyze these results too much, as due to time constraints, I wasn't able to investigate confounding factors like the prompt I used for rule articulation, the fact that rule articulation is done with `o4-mini` despite classification being done with `GPT-4.1`. Additionally, since $D$ is small, and we didn't run a lot of trials for each experiment, it seems that the outputs are fairly noisy.

Even still, these results are definitely interesting to me, and I wonder if there are less trivial environments to test similar behavior.
